Given a binary tree root. Split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing 1 edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees are maximized.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 110
Explanation: Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 11 and 10. Their product is 110 (11*10)
Example 2:



Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,null,null,5,6]
Output: 90
Explanation:  Remove the red edge and get 2 binary trees with sum 15 and 6.Their product is 90 (15*6)
Example 3:

Input: root = [2,3,9,10,7,8,6,5,4,11,1]
Output: 1025
Example 4:

Input: root = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

Each tree has at most 50000 nodes and at least 2 nodes.
Each node's value is between [1, 10000].
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution: #O(n)
    def maxProduct(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        sumSubs = []
        res = [0, -float('inf')]
        maxRes = 10 ** 9 + 7
        def scan(root):
            nonlocal sumSubs
            if not root:
                return 0
            sumCur = scan(root.left) + scan(root.right) + root.val
            sumSubs.append(sumCur)
            return sumCur
        
        sumRoot = scan(root)
        for sumSub in sumSubs[:-1]:
            resN, resProduct = res
            curProduct = sumSub * (sumRoot-sumSub) % maxRes
            n = sumSub * (sumRoot - sumSub) // maxRes
            if resN < n:
                res = [n, curProduct]
            elif resN == n and resProduct < curProduct:
                res = [n, curProduct]
            else:
                pass
                
        return res[1]
```
scan the whole tree and collect sum of subtree, then minus each of sum of subtree and calculate product
