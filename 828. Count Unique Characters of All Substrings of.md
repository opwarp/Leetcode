Let's define a function countUniqueChars(s) that returns the number of unique characters on s, for example if s = "LEETCODE" then "L", "T","C","O","D" are the unique characters since they appear only once in s, therefore countUniqueChars(s) = 5.

On this problem given a string s we need to return the sum of countUniqueChars(t) where t is a substring of s. Notice that some substrings can be repeated so on this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 10 ^ 9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABC"
Output: 10
Explanation: All possible substrings are: "A","B","C","AB","BC" and "ABC".
Evey substring is composed with only unique letters.
Sum of lengths of all substring is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10
Example 2:

Input: s = "ABA"
Output: 8
Explanation: The same as example 1, except countUniqueChars("ABA") = 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "LEETCODE"
Output: 92
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 10^4
s contain upper-case English letters only.
```python
class Solution: # O(n) time, O(n) space
    def uniqueLetterString(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        resi = 0
        cPos = {}
        maxN = 10 ** 9 + 7
        for i, c  in enumerate(s):
            if c not in cPos.keys():
                cPos[c] = [-1, -1]
            last2, last1 = cPos[c][0], cPos[c][1]
            incri = (i - last1) - (last1 - last2)

            resi += incri
            resi %= maxN 
            
            res += resi
            res %= maxN 
            
            cPos[c][0] = last1
            cPos[c][1] = i
        return res
```
Suppose the input string is "MLEAEPLCL".

Below numbers represents the unique count for a substring that starts from s[0] to s[i], where i is the index of current iteration.
The reason we want to track this is that at each step i, we are adding all new substrings that ends with the new character at s[i].
We don't care about any substrings that does not end with the new char at the end, since they are already in the total counts.
As we will show below, we only actually need to track the SUM at each end, instead of actual individual values!

Each line below is what we would see during an iteration:

M L E A E P L C L   SUM
1                     1 # No repeat, + len of scanned substring (1)
2 1                   3 # No repeat, + len of scanned substring (2), as we are adding 1 to all seen substrings (unique_count("L") == 1, unique_count("ML") == 2)
3 2 1                 6 # No repeat, + len of scanned substring (3), as we are adding 1 to all seen substrings
4 3 2 1              10
3 2 1 2 1             9 # Introduces repeat, all counts before repeat has to -1, while all counts after repeat +1, in total delta from last sum is (-3+2) = -1
4 3 2 3 2 1          15
3 2 3 4 3 2 1        18 # Introduces another repeat, all counts before repeat has to -1, while all counts after repeat +1, in total delta from last sum is (-2+5) = +3
4 3 4 5 4 3 2 1      26
4 3 3 4 3 2 1 2 1    23 # Introduces a repeat on top of an existing repeat, all counts between the last 2 previous occurrences -1, all counts after repeat +1, no change for the rest at the beginning (they have already been deducted in the past, the new repeat does not matter), delta is (-5+2) = -3

Notice that while we are reasoning, we only need to compute the delta. Therefore there is no need to keep the full list of values, tracking last SUM is good enough.
incr and decr means the incr amount (until first repeat, aka second occurrence from currently scanned last char) and decr amount (between first and second repeats).
We can compute the delta of the sum at each step by just saving the indices of last 2 repeats.
