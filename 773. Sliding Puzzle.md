On a 2x3 board, there are 5 tiles represented by the integers 1 through 5, and an empty square represented by 0.

A move consists of choosing 0 and a 4-directionally adjacent number and swapping it.

The state of the board is solved if and only if the board is [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].

Given a puzzle board, return the least number of moves required so that the state of the board is solved. If it is impossible for the state of the board to be solved, return -1.

Examples:

Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and the 5 in one move.
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: No number of moves will make the board solved.
Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the smallest number of moves that solves the board.
An example path:
After move 0: [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
After move 1: [[4,1,2],[0,5,3]]
After move 2: [[0,1,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 3: [[1,0,2],[4,5,3]]
After move 4: [[1,2,0],[4,5,3]]
After move 5: [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]]
Input: board = [[3,2,4],[1,5,0]]
Output: 14
Note:

board will be a 2 x 3 array as described above.
board[i][j] will be a permutation of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

                bd = list(bd) # transfer to list, enable elements to swap
                for dest, orient in [[pos0-n,'v'], [pos0+n,'v'], [pos0-1,'h'], [pos0+1,'h']]:
                    moveV = orient == 'v' and dest < m*n and dest >= 0 # valid vertical move
                    moveH = orient == 'h' and dest // n == pos0 // n # valid horizon move, destinatioin and origin position are in same line
                    if moveV or moveH:
                        bd[pos0], bd[dest] = bd[dest], bd[pos0] # swap characters 
                        bdNext = ''.join(bd)
                        if bdNext not in boards:
                            boards.add(bdNext)
                            dq.append([bdNext, step+1])
                        bd[pos0], bd[dest] = bd[dest], bd[pos0] # swap characters back for next loop
        return -1
```
use bfs, start from end, find the earlyest broadcast to match input
